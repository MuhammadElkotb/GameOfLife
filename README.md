#Introduction

    Conway's Game of Life or Life or GOF is a Cellular automated game
    created by British Mathmetician John Conway in 1970 in which cell is alive or dead.
    Each Cell's next generation state is determined by the current state of its 8 neighbours 
    (up, left, down, right, upleft, downright, downleft, upright).
    The Game future states depends solely on its initial state.


#Rules

    if a Cell is Dead : 

        it will be alive the next generation(step) if it has exactly 3 alive neighhours 
    else 
        the cell remains dead.
    
 
if a Cell is Alive :

    it will die if it has 4 or more alive neighbours due to overpopulation.
    
    it will die if it has 1 or less alive neighbours due to underpopulation.
    
    it will continue to live to the next generation if it has 2 or 3 alive neighbours.
    
  
  #Why it is Important
  
      A person cannot logically or mathematically predict the future state of the game  
      It is very interseting and fun way to show and discuss undecidability in Mathmetaics.
